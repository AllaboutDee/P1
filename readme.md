### **Target Audiences:**
* Surfing enthusiasts of all levels
* Families seeking activities to enjoy together
* Individuals wanting to meet like-minded adventurers
* Community-oriented travelers and beach culture fans
* People eager to explore, learn, and connect within a supportive group
* Prospective new members who want to learn, participate, or get involved in future events and activities

### **User Stories:**

### **Site Aims:**

* Engaging: Use visual elements and a clear layout to attract and retain visitor attention.
* Community-focused: Promote connection among users through events, gallery images, and sign-up options.

### **How Will This Be Achieved:**

Each aim is reflected in the design choices, such as the use of high-quality images, event schedules, a gallery page, and a signup form. The site also has a clean layout, fast loading times, and accessibility considerations, ensuring a smooth experience.

* The **Home page** has a white background with vibrant colors and images reflecting surf and sea. The header and buttons are in blue/green tones, while reds and oranges in the cover text complement the visuals, tying it all together.

### **Color Scheme:**

I selected a vibrant color scheme inspired by the sea, with blues and greens as primary colors and touches of red, orange, and yellow reflecting a sunset sky. A white background makes these colors stand out, while the header’s `#bdf2f6` color complements the hero image. The cover text container features an orange/coral tone to contrast the hero image and tie into the theme cohesively.

## **Deployment**

### Wireframes

Wireframes:
I used****** to make a visual representation of the surfing website. Below are the initial design ideas: * ![Homepage] () * ![Gallery] () * ![Signup] () COME BACK TO THIS SECTON

Color Scheme:
I wanted the colour scheme to vibrant with the main colour being a mix of blue and green to reflect the sea and waves with splashes of reds, oranges and yellows reflective of the dark sunset sky. I wanted the bright header and pictures to be contrasted against a white background so that the colours really stand out. For the background colour of the header I chose #bdf2f6. I did this by uploading the hero image first and then playing with the colour palette to find a colour that matches well without being too clashy. The container for the cover-text had to be a contrast colour to show against the hero image. I went for an orange/coral shade to complement the skin tones and red/orange colour shorts of the surfers aswell as the sunset sky in the image further down the page. . The little splashes of colours really makes the page stand out even more.
