    ## **Planning stage**

* Community-focused: Promote connection among users through events, gallery images, and sign-up options.

### **How Will This Be Achieved:**

Each aim is reflected in the design choices, such as the use of high-quality images, event schedules, a gallery page, and a signup form. The site also has a clean layout, fast loading times, and accessibility considerations, ensuring a smooth experience.

* The Home page will have a white background contrasted with splashes of beautiful vibrant colours and images related surf and sea. The header and buttons will be a blue/green colour, and any cover text may be reds or oranges to play of other colours within the images used so help it all tie in nicely.
* The Home page will have  clear sections such as the header, main image, welcome section with a clickable button which take you to the sign-up page, a why join section, Upcoming schedule section, footer will have links to the social media pages.
* The Gallery section will have lots of vibrant pictures of members surfing, relaxing, partying, playing other sport and amazing surf spots visited to showcase that it is a club but a close- knit community that like to learn, travel and have fun. 
* The sign-up page has 1 image of members and an easy to complete sign up form which options to ask a question, inquire about memberships, sign up to the newsletter or leave a comment. 

### **Wireframes:**
I used****** to make a visual representation of the surfing website. Below are the initial design ideas:
    * ![Homepage] ()
    * ![Gallery] ()
    * ![Signup] ()
    COME BACK TO THIS SECTON

### **Color Scheme:**

I wanted the colour scheme to vibrant with the main colour being a mix of blue and green to reflect the sea and waves with splashes of reds, oranges and yellows reflective of the dark sunset sky. I wanted the bright header and pictures to be contrasted against a white background so that the colours really stand out. For the  background colour of the header I chose #bdf2f6. I did this by uploading the hero image first and then playing with the colour palette to find a colour that matches well without being too clashy. 
The container for the cover-text had to be a contrast colour to show against the hero image. I went for an orange/coral shade to complement the skin tones and red/orange colour shorts of the surfers aswell as the sunset sky in the image further down the page.  . The little splashes of colours really makes the page stand out even more.

### *Footer:*
The footer includes social media links for Facebook, X-app, YouTube and Instagram.  I have gone for a dark grey background with the social media icons in white for a nice contrast.  This is style to contrast against the white background of the body.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

1. As a user, I want to navigate easily across the site to find relevant information.
    1. The navigation bar is simple and easy to use. In mobile view this becomes a burger bar with a drop down option.
2. As a user I want to see upcoming events easily.
    1. The upcoming events are clearly listed on the home page, with the location and date.
3. As a user I want to easily see what the website is about.
    1. The website is clear and logical. Information is in relevant sections and in small chunks and it is not over-crowded. 
4. As a user I want to see an aesthetically pleasing website.
    1. The website is layed out nicely into sections with stunning pictures and a vibrant colour palette is used throughout.
5. As a user I want to know my information is safe and secure so that I can interact with others confidently.
    1. Users can complete the signup form safely and securely, which allows them submit basic informatio such as their name and email address and their questions or reason for contact. 
    2. Currently the basic details are entered and someone will respond off teh back of the query. Currently the website does not ask more personal information then that but as the website grows it will lst more information and allows customers to sign up on line and buy merchandise at which more more safety features would be added. 
    3. At this stage of the build, the functionality for chat, sign-in and profile pages has not been implemented. 
6. As a user, I want the site to be accessible and look visually appealing on my mobile, ipad and laptop device.
    1. The website design is responsive  from mobile to ipad to laptop in most cases. There is an issue with the logo and menu overlap on Samsung S8+ and Galaxy Z fold 5. Also there is an issue with header and cover-text overlap on ipad Mini. Due to time constraints this issue has not yet been correct.  
7. As a user and a prospective member, I want a clear sign-up form to join
    1. The signup form has a very simple layout. It is easy to understand and use. It offers the option of signing up to the newsletter, leaving a comment or asking a question. You can enter your level of surfing expertise aswell. 

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop and android phones.
-   Testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly without time delays.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Accessibility
I wanted to ensure the site supported all visitors, I included the following in my code to ensure this:

* All images contained an alt tag
* All images were saved as webp or jpg, for a reduced file size to support the load time of images
* The site is responsive to different screen sizes 
* Semantic elements were used throughout the design

### ***Known Bugs***


* The logo and burger menu overlap slightly in mobile view for the Galaxy S8+ and Galaxy Z Fold 5. I was unable to rectify this without causing further distotion to the web page, i there fore reversed the changes and will work on fixing these errors properly. 
* The container with the cover image on the home page is partly hidden behind the header on ipad Mini view. I was unable to remediate this without causing further distortion to the webpage. I will look to fix this error in due course.

## **Deployment**
I deployed the page on GitHub pages via the following procedure: -

1. From the project's [repository](https://github.com/AllaboutDee/P1), go to the **Settings** tab.
2. From the left-hand menu, select the **Pages** tab.
3. Under the **Source** section, select the **Main** branch from the drop-down menu and click **Save**.
4. A message will be displayed to indicate a successful deployment to GitHub pages and provide the live link.
