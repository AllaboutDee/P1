Wireframes:
I used****** to make a visual representation of the surfing website. Below are the initial design ideas: * ![Homepage] () * ![Gallery] () * ![Signup] () COME BACK TO THIS SECTON

Color Scheme:
I wanted the colour scheme to vibrant with the main colour being a mix of blue and green to reflect the sea and waves with splashes of reds, oranges and yellows reflective of the dark sunset sky. I wanted the bright header and pictures to be contrasted against a white background so that the colours really stand out. For the background colour of the header I chose #bdf2f6. I did this by uploading the hero image first and then playing with the colour palette to find a colour that matches well without being too clashy. The container for the cover-text had to be a contrast colour to show against the hero image. I went for an orange/coral shade to complement the skin tones and red/orange colour shorts of the surfers aswell as the sunset sky in the image further down the page. . The little splashes of colours really makes the page stand out even more.

Footer:
The footer includes social media links for Facebook, X-app, YouTube and Instagram. I have gone for a dark grey background with the social media icons in white for a nice contrast. This is style to contrast against the white background of the body.

Your README draft is comprehensive, but I’ve highlighted some suggested improvements and edits for clarity, readability, and consistency:

Suggested Edits and Improvements
Website Overview Section

Consider clarifying the site’s purpose at the beginning of this section:

"Welcome to Surfing & Paradise – a community-driven site that connects surfing enthusiasts of all levels. Whether you're a beginner, intermediate, or advanced, Surfing & Paradise offers resources and events for skill-building, community engagement, and fun experiences."

Rephrase "The club is family-friendly and encourages..." for improved flow:

"The club welcomes families, encouraging members to bring their kids along to enjoy surfing together as a family-friendly sport."

Table of Contents Formatting

The formatting of the "Table of Contents" can be cleaned up for clarity by aligning bullet points or indenting sections where needed.
Planning Stage (Grammar and Clarity)

Remove "each section" to avoid redundancy and keep it concise:
"During the planning stage, key elements were defined to shape the site’s structure, focusing on user experience (UX) principles, aesthetic style, and interactive features for both desktop and mobile views."

Target Audiences Section

Under "Target Audiences," simplify points for readability:
"Individuals interested in surfing, families seeking group activities, people looking to meet like-minded adventurers, community-oriented travelers, and those eager to enjoy the beach culture or conquer their fear of water and weather."

User Stories Consistency

Merge duplicate user stories and adjust minor inconsistencies:
"As a user, I want to find upcoming events and search by specific criteria (e.g., location, date)."
"As a user, I want secure handling of my information to confidently engage with others."
"As a user, I want to find local businesses related to my needs."
Site Aims (Improvement for Clarity)

Clarify points related to "Site Aims" that reference another audience:
"To create a safe, welcoming space with a focus on cultural connections, relationship building, business visibility, and community interaction."
"To represent and support the African and Caribbean communities."
Color Scheme Section (Grammar and Flow)

Rephrase for clarity and flow, such as:
"I chose a vibrant color scheme inspired by the sea, with blue and green tones complemented by splashes of red, orange, and yellow, reflecting a sunset sky. The white background ensures these colors pop, while the header is #bdf2f6 to harmonize with the hero image."

Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Section (Consistency)

Simplify descriptions for concise consistency:
"Git: Used for version control, allowing commits to Git and pushes to GitHub."
"GitHub: Hosted the project repository after pushes from Git."
Remove unneeded URL formatting in tools such as "VisualStudioCode" (just keep the name).
Header Element & Logo (Clarify Descriptions)

Reword for concise descriptions and clarity:
"Logos: Styled in the 'Great Vibes' font, the logo sits centrally in the header, with a dark color that contrasts the background and complements the ocean theme."

Footer Section (Consistency)

Add "social media icons" for clarity:
"The footer has social media icons for Facebook, X-app, YouTube, and Instagram, styled in white against a dark grey background for contrast."

Future Enhancements
For "Future-Enhancements," ensure each point is action-oriented:
"Expand Event Calendar: Introduce interactive elements for displaying events."
"Add E-commerce Feature: Enable direct purchases of branded merchandise."
"Include more details on membership fees, surf classes, instructors, and other resources."
Wireframes Section Placeholder
Ensure "Wireframes" includes necessary details or a clear placeholder reminder:
"Add visual representation of wireframes here."

These adjustments will make your README clearer, easier to follow, and more professional for your target readers. Let me know if you’d like specific rewording in any section!

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

1. As a user, I want to navigate easily across the site to find relevant information.
    1. The navigation bar is simple and easy to use. In mobile view this becomes a burger bar with a drop down option.
2. As a user I want to see upcoming events easily.
    1. The upcoming events are clearly listed on the home page, with the location and date.
3. As a user I want to easily see what the website is about.
    1. The website is clear and logical. Information is in relevant sections and in small chunks and it is not over-crowded. 
4. As a user I want to see an aesthetically pleasing website.
    1. The website is layed out nicely into sections with stunning pictures and a vibrant colour palette is used throughout.
5. As a user I want to know my information is safe and secure so that I can interact with others confidently.
    1. Users can complete the signup form safely and securely, which allows them submit basic informatio such as their name and email address and their questions or reason for contact. 
    2. Currently the basic details are entered and someone will respond off teh back of the query. Currently the website does not ask more personal information then that but as the website grows it will lst more information and allows customers to sign up on line and buy merchandise at which more more safety features would be added. 
    3. At this stage of the build, the functionality for chat, sign-in and profile pages has not been implemented. 
6. As a user, I want the site to be accessible and look visually appealing on my mobile, ipad and laptop device.
    1. The website design is responsive  from mobile to ipad to laptop in most cases. There is an issue with the logo and menu overlap on Samsung S8+ and Galaxy Z fold 5. Also there is an issue with header and cover-text overlap on ipad Mini. Due to time constraints this issue has not yet been correct.  
7. As a user and a prospective member, I want a clear sign-up form to join
    1. The signup form has a very simple layout. It is easy to understand and use. It offers the option of signing up to the newsletter, leaving a comment or asking a question. You can enter your level of surfing expertise aswell. 

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop and android phones.
-   Testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly without time delays.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Accessibility
I wanted to ensure the site supported all visitors, I included the following in my code to ensure this:

* All images contained an alt tag
* All images were saved as webp or jpg, for a reduced file size to support the load time of images
* The site is responsive to different screen sizes 
* Semantic elements were used throughout the design

### ***Known Bugs***


* The logo and burger menu overlap slightly in mobile view for the Galaxy S8+ and Galaxy Z Fold 5. I was unable to rectify this without causing further distotion to the web page, i there fore reversed the changes and will work on fixing these errors properly. 
* The container with the cover image on the home page is partly hidden behind the header on ipad Mini view. I was unable to remediate this without causing further distortion to the webpage. I will look to fix this error in due course.

## **Deployment**
I deployed the page on GitHub pages via the following procedure: -

1. From the project's [repository](https://github.com/AllaboutDee/P1), go to the **Settings** tab.
2. From the left-hand menu, select the **Pages** tab.
3. Under the **Source** section, select the **Main** branch from the drop-down menu and click **Save**.
4. A message will be displayed to indicate a successful deployment to GitHub pages and provide the live link.
