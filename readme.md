### **How Will This Be Achieved:**

Each aim is reflected in the design choices, such as the use of high-quality images, event schedules, a gallery page, and a signup form. The site also has a clean layout, fast loading times, and accessibility considerations, ensuring a smooth experience.

* The Home page will have a white background contrasted with splashes of beautiful vibrant colours and images related surf and sea. The header and buttons will be a blue/green colour, and any cover text may be reds or oranges to play of other colours within the images used so help it all tie in nicely.
* The Home page will have  clear sections such as the header, main image, welcome section with a clickable button which take you to the sign-up page, a why join section, Upcoming schedule section, footer will have links to the social media pages.
* The Gallery section will have lots of vibrant pictures of members surfing, relaxing, partying, playing other sport and amazing surf spots visited to showcase that it is a club but a close- knit community that like to learn, travel and have fun. 
* The sign-up page has 1 image of members and an easy to complete sign up form which options to ask a question, inquire about memberships, sign up to the newsletter or leave a comment. 

### **Wireframes:**

    * ![Homepage] ()
    * ![Gallery] ()
    * ![Signup] ()
    COME BACK TO THIS SECTON

### **Color Scheme:**

I wanted the colour scheme to vibrant with the main colour being a mix of blue and green to reflect the sea and waves with splashes of reds, oranges and yellows reflective of the dark sunset sky. I wanted the bright header and pictures to be contrasted against a white background so that the colours really stand out. For the  background colour of the header I chose #bdf2f6. I did this by uploading the hero image first and then playing with the colour palette to find a colour that matches well without being too clashy. 
The container for the cover-text had to be a contrast colour to show against the hero image. I went for an orange/coral shade to complement the skin tones and red/orange colour shorts of the surfers aswell as the sunset sky in the image further down the page.  . The little splashes of colours really makes the page stand out even more.
