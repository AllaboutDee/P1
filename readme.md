### **Color Scheme:**

I selected a vibrant color scheme inspired by the sea, with blues and greens as primary colors and touches of red, orange, and yellow reflecting a sunset sky. A white background makes these colors stand out, while the header’s `#bdf2f6` color complements the hero image. The cover text container features an orange/coral tone to contrast the hero image and tie into the theme cohesively.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

1. As a user, I want to navigate easily across the site to find relevant information.
    1. The navigation bar is simple and easy to use. In mobile view this becomes a burger bar with a drop down option.
2. As a user I want to see upcoming events easily.
    1. The upcoming events are clearly listed on the home page, with the location and date.
3. As a user I want to easily see what the website is about.
    1. The website is clear and logical. Information is in relevant sections and in small chunks and it is not over-crowded. 
4. As a user I want to see an aesthetically pleasing website.
    1. The website is layed out nicely into sections with stunning pictures and a vibrant colour palette is used throughout.
5. As a user I want to know my information is safe and secure so that I can interact with others confidently.
    1. Users can complete the signup form safely and securely, which allows them to submit basic information such as their name and email address along with their questions or reason for contact. They can easily sign up to the newsletter.
    2. Currently the basic details are entered and someone will respond off the back of the query. At this stage the website does not ask more personal information then that but as the website grows it will list more information and allow customers to sign up for membership on line and buy merchandise at which point more safety features would be added. 
    3. At this stage of the build, the functionality for chat, sign-in and profile pages has not been implemented. 
6. As a user, I want the site to be accessible and look visually appealing on my mobile, ipad and laptop device.
    1. The website design is responsive  from mobile to ipad to laptop in most cases. There is an slight issue where the logo and menu overlap on Samsung S8+ and Galaxy Z fold 5. Also there is an issue where the header and cover-text overlap on ipad Mini. Due to time constraints this issue has not yet been correct.  
7. As a user and a prospective member, I want a clear sign-up form to join
    1. The signup form has a very simple layout. It is easy to understand and use. It offers the option of signing up to the newsletter, leaving a comment or asking a question. You can enter your level of surfing expertise aswell.
